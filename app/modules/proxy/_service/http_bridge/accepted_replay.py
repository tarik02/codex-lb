"""Replay accepted, output-free capacity failures within one response lifecycle.

Upstream can accept a ``response.create`` -- ``response.created`` and usually
``response.in_progress`` reach the client -- and then fail the turn before it
produces any output, either with a capacity terminal (``server_is_overloaded``,
``overloaded_error``, ``model_at_capacity``, or the "selected model is at
capacity" message) or by dropping the transport. Every side effect of a
Responses turn is reported as an output item or as billed output tokens, so
such a turn is as replay-safe as a pre-created failure. The helpers here let
the existing pre-created replay machinery (``replay_downstream_response_id`` +
prelude suppression + id rewriting) cover that state: the request is re-sent
once -- on another account when its body is account-neutral, otherwise to the
account that accepted it (a client-supplied anchor or an account-bound fresh
body keeps the anchored body on its owner) -- while the client keeps reading
the single lifecycle it already observed. Quota and rate-limit terminals after
acceptance deliberately stay fail-closed; see the openspec change
``retry-accepted-output-free-capacity-failures``.
