## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Removed tunables are fixed constants, derived values, or dashboard settings

Values that are protocol constants or internal tuning details SHALL NOT be
operator-configurable, and values the dashboard runtime settings own SHALL NOT
also be operator-configurable through the environment. When a previously
supported `CODEX_LB_*` setting is removed from the configuration surface, its
environment variable MUST be ignored without failing startup, and for at
least one release after removal, startup MUST emit a single warning log
listing every removed setting name found in the process environment or the
loaded env files (never the values), referencing the simplicity principle
that motivated the removal. Once a removed name has had its warning release,
it MUST be pruned from the warning list while staying inert (`extra="ignore"`);
the warning list therefore covers only the most recent removal batch. Each
subsystem affected by a removal MUST retain at most one enable/disable
setting, and the Helm chart MUST NOT render environment variables for removed
settings.

The following values MUST be fixed at their previously documented defaults:

- The OAuth protocol identity values (authorization base URL, client id,
  originator, scope, redirect URI, and callback port): they identify
  codex-lb to OpenAI exactly like the Codex CLI, and changing any of them
  breaks login.
- Background scheduler cadences (quota planner tick, automations poll,
  model registry refresh, sticky-session cleanup).
- The Codex client fingerprint (OS, architecture, terminal).
- Live-usage write coalescing (minimum write interval and queue size).
- The request-log count-cache TTL.
- Circuit-breaker tuning (failure threshold and recovery timeout).
- The images-route internals (internal host model and partial-images cap).
- The PostgreSQL pool checkout timeout (30 seconds) and pooled-connection
  recycle window (1800 seconds).
- The soft-drain/probe thresholds (primary drain threshold 85%, secondary
  drain threshold 90%, error window 60 seconds, error count 2, probe quiet
  window 60 seconds, probe success streak 3), fixed in
  `app/core/balancer/logic.py`.
- The never-tuned core tunables constantized by `constantize-core-tunables`:
  the upstream SSE event / websocket frame budget (16 MiB) and the derived
  serialized `response.create` budget (15 MiB); the OAuth exchange timeout
  (30 s), token-refresh exchange timeout (8 s), refresh-failure negative
  cache (5 s) and the token-refresh claim TTL (`max(30 s, admission wait +
  2 x refresh timeout)`, all in code); the admission wait (10 s) and the
  token-refresh (64), upstream websocket connect (128) and compact
  response-create (64) gates; the usage / reset-credits fetch timeout (10 s)
  and retry budget (2), the usage refresh interval (60 s) with its derived
  freshness horizon, the usage auth-failure cooldown (300 s) and the
  reset-credits polling interval (60 s); the always-on switches for usage
  refresh, live usage ingestion, sticky-session cleanup, the model registry
  and the quota planner scheduler (the dashboard `quota_planner_settings.mode
  = "off"` remains the only planner switch); the HTTP ingress body budgets
  (32 MiB general, 128 MiB Responses); inline image fetching (always on, no
  host allowlist); the public default image model (`gpt-image-2`); and
  proxy-generated prompt-cache-key derivation (always on). There is no
  separate upstream compact timeout: the dashboard compact request budget is
  the only cap.

The following values MUST be derived rather than configured:

- The memory-pressure warning threshold: 80% of the configurable reject
  threshold (`CODEX_LB_MEMORY_REJECT_THRESHOLD_MB`), with both disabled
  when the reject threshold is 0.
- The background-task database engine's pool size and max overflow: always
  taken from `database_pool_size` and `database_max_overflow`.

The following values MUST be owned by the dashboard runtime settings alone,
with the first-created settings row taking the column defaults (`smart`,
`1800`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `false`) instead of an environment seed:
`http_downstream_transport_policy`, `openai_cache_affinity_max_age_seconds`,
`warmup_model`, and `http_responses_session_bridge_gateway_safe_mode`. The
retention windows (`request_log_retention_days`,
`usage_history_retention_days`) MUST be dashboard runtime settings with no
environment alias (see `data-retention`).

Incident-debugging trace logging SHALL be controlled by the single
`CODEX_LB_TRACE` comma-separated channel list, whose empty default disables
all trace channels. The Codex HTTP-bridge prewarm rollout scoping SHALL NOT
be operator-configurable: prewarm eligibility MUST be the single
`http_responses_session_bridge_codex_prewarm_enabled` switch alone, with no
canary sampling percent and no API-key allow/deny cohort lists. That switch
MUST be a dashboard runtime setting (a nullable `dashboard_settings` column of
the same name, NULL on the first-created row and never seeded from the
environment) whose
`CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_CODEX_PREWARM_ENABLED` variable is a
deprecated alias that applies only while the column is NULL and that joins the
removed-settings warning list in the next minor release. The bridge MUST
resolve the switch before it takes a session's prewarm lock, from the dashboard
overrides the request entry point already bound. The prewarm's own helpers
MUST NOT read the dashboard row for themselves while that lock is held: the
values the response-create admission gate needs (account concurrency caps and
routing tunables) and the row the reconnect on the prewarm timeout path
resolves MUST come from one snapshot taken before the lock and passed in. If
that snapshot cannot be loaded, the bridge MUST fall back to the last
dashboard row the replica loaded, exactly as the request entry point does, and
where no row has ever been loaded it MUST skip the prewarm rather than serve
it without a snapshot; a prewarm MUST NOT fail a request the bridge can
otherwise serve. Work the recovery path reaches beyond those two helpers --
account selection, token refresh, and upstream route resolution, each with its
own settings read or database session -- is out of scope for this requirement
and keeps its existing behaviour.
`database_pool_size` and `database_max_overflow` MUST remain
operator-configurable settings, and `soft_drain_enabled` and
`deterministic_failover_enabled` MUST remain the failover subsystem's only
enable switches. Those two switches and `circuit_breaker_enabled` MUST be
dashboard runtime settings (`dashboard_settings` columns of the same name,
NULL on the first-created row; see `account-routing` and
`outbound-http-clients`) whose `CODEX_LB_*` variables are deprecated aliases
that apply only while the column is NULL and that join the removed-settings
warning list in the next minor release.

#### Scenario: Removed env vars are ignored with one startup warning

- **GIVEN** a deployment whose environment still sets removed settings such
  as `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` and
  `CODEX_LB_USAGE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** startup succeeds and the dashboard runtime values are used
- **AND** exactly one warning log lists both removed names without their
  values

#### Scenario: Clean environment starts without removal warnings

- **GIVEN** a deployment that sets no removed setting names
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** no removed-settings warning is logged

#### Scenario: Names past their warning release are silently inert

- **GIVEN** a deployment whose environment still sets names removed in an
  earlier batch, such as `CODEX_LB_AUTH_BASE_URL`,
  `CODEX_LB_QUOTA_PLANNER_TICK_SECONDS`, or
  `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE_SECONDS`
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** startup succeeds, the fixed built-in values are used
- **AND** no removed-settings warning is logged for those names

#### Scenario: Trace channels default to off

- **GIVEN** a default install with `CODEX_LB_TRACE` unset
- **WHEN** the proxy serves requests
- **THEN** no request-shape, payload, service-tier, or upstream trace logs
  are emitted

#### Scenario: A trace channel can be enabled for an incident

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_TRACE=shape,upstream_payload`
- **WHEN** the proxy serves requests
- **THEN** request-shape and upstream-payload trace logs are emitted while
  all other trace channels stay off

#### Scenario: Memory warning threshold derives from the reject threshold

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_MEMORY_REJECT_THRESHOLD_MB=100`
- **WHEN** process RSS reaches 80 MiB
- **THEN** a memory warning is logged while requests continue to be served
- **AND** requests are rejected with 503 only once RSS reaches 100 MiB

#### Scenario: Memory guard stays fully disabled by default

- **GIVEN** a default install with `CODEX_LB_MEMORY_REJECT_THRESHOLD_MB`
  unset (0)
- **WHEN** the proxy serves requests under any memory usage
- **THEN** no memory warning is logged and no request is rejected for
  memory pressure

#### Scenario: Helm chart renders no removed settings

- **GIVEN** a Helm install using the chart's default values
- **WHEN** the config map is rendered
- **THEN** it contains no `CODEX_LB_OPENAI_CACHE_AFFINITY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`,
  `CODEX_LB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, or
  `CODEX_LB_STICKY_SESSION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` entries
- **AND** startup emits no removed-settings warning

#### Scenario: Dashboard-owned columns seed from their defaults

- **GIVEN** a fresh database and `CODEX_LB_WARMUP_MODEL=gpt-5.4-nano` still
  set in the environment
- **WHEN** the dashboard settings row is created for the first time
- **THEN** `warmup_model` is `gpt-5.4-mini`, `http_downstream_transport_policy`
  is `smart`, and `openai_cache_affinity_max_age_seconds` is `1800`
- **AND** the startup warning names `CODEX_LB_WARMUP_MODEL`

#### Scenario: Fresh database bootstrap ignores a removed variable

- **GIVEN** an empty database and
  `CODEX_LB_OPENAI_CACHE_AFFINITY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=64` still set in the
  environment
- **WHEN** the Alembic chain is upgraded to head
- **THEN** the seeded `dashboard_settings` row has
  `openai_cache_affinity_max_age_seconds` `1800`
- **AND** no migration reads the removed variable

#### Scenario: Removed names are matched case-insensitively

- **GIVEN** a deployment whose environment sets `codex_lb_warmup_model`
  in lowercase (which the former field honoured)
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the startup warning lists `CODEX_LB_WARMUP_MODEL`

#### Scenario: Background pool sizing derives from the main pool settings

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=12` and
  `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=4` on a PostgreSQL deployment
- **WHEN** the application creates the background-task database engine
- **THEN** the background engine uses pool size 12 and max overflow 4
- **AND** no separate background pool sizing can be configured

#### Scenario: Drain and probe thresholds are fixed constants

- **GIVEN** a deployment with `soft_drain_enabled` left at its default
- **WHEN** an account's primary window usage reaches 85%
- **THEN** the account enters the draining health tier
- **AND** a drained account enters the probing tier only after the fixed
  60-second quiet window, regardless of any `CODEX_LB_PROBE_QUIET_SECONDS`
  value still present in the environment

#### Scenario: Prewarm stays off by default

- **GIVEN** a default install with no prewarm variables set and the dashboard
  prewarm switch unset (NULL)
- **WHEN** Codex bridge requests are served
- **THEN** no session prewarm is attempted and visible requests record
  `prewarm_status=not_applicable`

#### Scenario: Prewarm eligibility is the enabled flag alone

- **GIVEN** the Codex session prewarm switch is on, either in the dashboard or
  through `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_CODEX_PREWARM_ENABLED=true`
  while the dashboard value is unset
- **WHEN** a first-turn Codex bridge request arrives on a session that has
  not been prewarmed
- **THEN** the session prewarm is attempted for that request
- **AND** no request is excluded by canary sampling or an allow/deny cohort

#### Scenario: A prewarm's own helpers read no settings under its lock

- **GIVEN** the Codex session prewarm switch is on in the dashboard
- **WHEN** a session prewarm runs its body under the prewarm lock -- the
  warm-up request built, response-create admission taken for it, and the
  warm-up sent upstream to a stream that completes
- **THEN** the dashboard settings row is read once, before the lock is taken
- **AND** the admission gate takes no settings read of its own while the lock
  is held, and that path opens no database session

#### Scenario: An unreadable settings row does not fail the request

- **GIVEN** the Codex session prewarm switch is on and the settings row cannot
  be loaded when a first-turn Codex bridge request arrives
- **WHEN** the bridge resolves its pre-lock snapshot
- **THEN** the last dashboard row this replica loaded is used and the prewarm
  proceeds
- **AND** where no row has ever been loaded, the prewarm records
  `prewarm_status=skipped` and the request is still served

#### Scenario: Prewarm env alias applies only until the dashboard sets a value

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_CODEX_PREWARM_ENABLED=true`
  and a `dashboard_settings` row whose
  `http_responses_session_bridge_codex_prewarm_enabled` column is NULL
- **WHEN** an operator turns the Codex session prewarm off in the dashboard
- **THEN** the next new Codex bridge session on every replica is served
  without a prewarm and without a restart, and the settings API reports
  `source: "dashboard"`
- **AND** clearing the dashboard value returns to the environment alias
  (`source: "env"`) until that alias is removed in the next minor release

#### Scenario: Resilience toggle env aliases apply only until the dashboard sets a value

- **GIVEN** `CODEX_LB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED=true` and a `dashboard_settings`
  row whose `circuit_breaker_enabled` column is NULL
- **WHEN** an operator sets the circuit breaker off in the dashboard
- **THEN** the next request runs with the breaker off on every replica without
  a restart, and the settings API reports `source: "dashboard"`
- **AND** clearing the dashboard value returns to the environment alias
  (`source: "env"`) until that alias is removed in the next minor release
